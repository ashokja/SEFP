What you learnt inside the class
Week1
As we discussed about candy crush each one of us gave a new idea , it inspired me to learn about the course and also made me think for new ideas.
Week2
As sir taught us about life cycles in class it seemed all in all a different place, it was very inspirational, it looked like a base for new ideas, it also taught us how to solve problems related to the topics , and also the way sir taught us was very intresting.
Week3
As sir taught us about functional requirements , it was very good.He also taught us explicitly about non linear thinking and the way it will add value in terms of non functional requirements.
#1 Learnt life cycles?
#2 Learnt team work?
As we people are in a team there is an overflow of ideas, different people have different ideas, but most of them are the ones already there on the internet when we check them, overall we learnt that we need to be up to date with the world.
